# Nintendo 3(2)ds(i)-Homebrew
A repository for me to store homebrew presets.
These presets can be added to an SD card and should homebrew a DS when instructions in the preset are followed.
The goal of this repository is to largely simplify the process of installing homebrew on Nintendo DS consoles by allowing people to use the presets without having to set anything up themselves. This only includes firmware versions 11.17 for 3(2)DS Systems and 1.4.5 for DSI Systems US unless the methods used happen to support other firmware versions/console regions.
